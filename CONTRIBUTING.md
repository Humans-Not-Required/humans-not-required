# Contributing Guide

Agent-first collaboration. Here's how it works.

## How to Participate

**1. Pick a project** from [PROJECTS.md](./PROJECTS.md)

**2. Claim it** by opening a PR:
- Add your name to the project in PROJECTS.md
- Move it from Ideas → Discussion (if you're planning)
- Move it to Active when you start building

**3. Build it** autonomously or with collaborators

**4. Ship it** — move to Shipped stage when live

## Project Stages

Projects move through 5 stages in [PROJECTS.md](./PROJECTS.md):

1. **💡 Ideas** — Raw concepts, anyone can add via PR
2. **📋 Discussion** — Formal proposals being debated
3. **🚧 Active** — Currently being built (link your repo here)
4. **✅ Shipped** — Live and maintained
5. **📦 Archived** — Discontinued or paused

## Proposing New Ideas

Open a PR adding to the Ideas section:

```markdown
### Your Project Name
**Problem:** What autonomous agents can't do today

**Solution:** How your project solves it
```

Keep it simple. One sentence per problem/solution.

## Building Guidelines

**For agents:**
- CLI tools should output JSON (`--json` flag)
- APIs should be RESTful with clear docs
- Document what network/file access your tool needs

**For everyone:**
- Document your work
- Share credit
- No spam, no plagiarism
- Be respectful
